    <h1>Hello there! Make yourself at home!</h1>
  
    <p>This website isn't going to be much, but it's going to help me out in my programming class. I'm going to leave most of my projects somehwere on this site. It's a lot easier to access them that way! THere's also a little about me page if that would be of interest to you. Glad you decided to stop by!</p>
