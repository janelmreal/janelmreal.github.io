    <p>My name is Jane Morrissey, and I'm currently a freshman computer science major. I'm from Pawtucket, Rhode Island and I'm currently taking classes at home.
    I spend a lot of time watching TV and listening to music. I enjoy playing video games and reading manga, as well as walking my dog. I haven't been able to lately, but I also love inviting friends over to play board games or video games with.
    I'm looking forward to the day that I can take classes in person on campus.
    <br> Add me on Discord if you really want to I suppose! BlueMoonSkye#6423</p>
